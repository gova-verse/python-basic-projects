# To-Do List App (Python)

A beginner-friendly command-line to-do list app built in Python.

## Features
- View all tasks with completion status (`✓` or `x`)
- Add new tasks from terminal input
- Mark tasks as done by selecting task number
- Delete tasks by task number
- Input checks for empty task names and invalid selections

## Project Goal
This project helps beginners practice:
- Lists and dictionaries for storing task data
- `while` loops for menu-driven programs
- Conditional logic (`if`/`elif`/`else`)
- Functions for organizing code into reusable parts
- User input handling and basic validation

## File Structure
```text
03_todo_list/
├── todo.py
└── README.md
```

## How to Run
From the repository root:

```bash
python 03_todo_list/todo.py
```
